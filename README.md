# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
I built this application to further my knowledge of node.js, inquirer, and jest. It serves as a useful tool to quickly and easily collect information about a team you are working with, and nicely display the information in an html file.

I learned a lot about js classes and constructors while building it, as well as how to properly test an application.

## Usage
See video walkthrough below. Use node to access the file from the command line, and then answer the prompts to fill out the profiles for each member of your team. When you are finished, the index.html file will automiatically generate based on the information you submitted.

## Tests
I have included tests for 4 of the javascript files, which can be accessed by inputting npm test in the command line. See video walkthrough above.
    
## Credits
This application requires inquirer to run, and I used jest for testing.
